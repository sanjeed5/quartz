I've always told others that I have a bad memory. I was bad at memorizing History facts back in school. Math/Science was easy while I had to put extra efforts into History/Geography. 

While in college I discovered Anki via Ali Abdaal (I am not a fan of his content anymore). I don't recall what I used it for, but it worked.

Recently, my younger sister was preparing for a quiz, and she had to remember a lot of information. I remembered Anki and I set it up for her. She enjoyed learning and I think the learning was much more effective. 

Now that made me want to try Anki again. I've been forgetting birthdays, phone numbers, and some general knowledge (which I realized when I went for a quiz recently).

Lot of good decks here: [Shared decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks)
Wow, there's a Learn Japanese with Anime deck. There's also a JEE/NEET prep deck. And this [Classical music shared deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/974811307)

But they say it's best to make your own decks.
