We all tend to get distracted sometimes. The modern world is just designed so now. 
Sure you can rely on your sheer willpower to be free. But sometimes it helps to have some support. 

I use [ScreenZen](https://www.screenzen.co/) on my Android phone. [Pawblock](https://www.pawblock.dannyguo.com/) on browser. 

I used to not need anything on my browser. But when I hit hard problems or am stressed about something, sometimes I tend to just open X or LinkedIn. 
The danger with X and LinkedIn is you feel like you're doing something useful/productive, but it's really not. It's just distracting you from deep work. 

I don't believe in hard blocking. You just need a moment to be mindful. That is why both the options don't fully block you out. You can "choose" to continue or not.
