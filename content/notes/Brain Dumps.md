Brain dumps. Morning pages. It's all the same idea. 

Sometimes, your brain is brimming with too many things. Too many thoughts, things to do, feelings, everything. 

And in your mind, it can feel like a lot. Putting it on paper, shows you how much more manageable this it. 

The steps are quite simple: 
1. Take a pen and paper. 
2. Just start writing. 

If you prefer writing digitally, then:
1. Go to 
	1. [Write Or](https://thewritepractice.com/write-or/) - reminds you to keep writing
	2. or [The Most Dangerous Writing App](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app) - you lose everything if you stop writing
2. Set a timer for 5 minutes
3. Start writing

I've found that the timer just forces you to get started and not overthink this.
