The menu is **Omakase**

*"How do you know what to order in a restaurant when you don’t know what’s good?* 

*Well, if you let the chef choose, you can probably assume a good meal, even before you know what “good” is. That is **omakase**.* 

*A way to eat well that requires you neither be an expert in the cuisine nor blessed with blind luck at picking in the dark."* 

I was thinking this is how products should be. Loved this concept.
